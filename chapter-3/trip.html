<h1>Segway' in USA</h1>
<p>Doumenting my trip around the US on my very own segway!</p>

<h2>June 2, 2012</h2>
<img src="../image/segway1.jpg">
<p>My first day of the trip! i can't believe i finally got everything packed and ready to go. because i'm on a Segway, i wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me
<ul>
<li>cell phone</li>
<li>ipod</li>
<li>digital camera</li>
<li>a protein bar</li>
</ul>
Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step Segway.</q></p>

<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: </p>

<blockquote>
    "passing cars,<br>
    When you can't see,<br> 
    May get you, <br>
    A glimpse,<br>
    Of eternity."
</blockquote>

<p>I definitely won't be passing and cars.</p>

<h2>August 20, 2012</h2>

<ol>
